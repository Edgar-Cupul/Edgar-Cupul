- 👀 I’m interested in Android, Java and web applications, including Cloud Computing (Amazon AWS and Google Cloud). I love work with C#/.NET Technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android development with Kotlin and Compose, using Jetpack Compose to create fun applications for my use. I want to deploy an app in playstore soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everyone who want to create APIs with .NET, or to develop an app in Flutter.
- 📫 How to reach me: I have 2 emails, so you can contact me with this: edgarcupul82@gmail.com, or ediroly@hotmail.com
